            <div>
                Narendra Damodardas Modi born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since 2014. Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He is also a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister to have been born after India's independence in 1947 and the second prime minister not belonging to the Indian National Congress to have won two consecutive elections, as well as a majority in both terms in the Indian lower house of parliament.

                Born and raised in Vadnagar, a small town in northeastern Gujarat, Modi completed his secondary education there, and is said to have helped his father sell tea at the local railway station. He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. Modi left home at age 18 soon after his marriage to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned and publicly acknowledged as his wife many decades later. Modi has asserted that he travelled around India for two years, visiting a number of religious centres. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency declared by Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi country in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary

            <span>Early life</span>
            <div>
                Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920). Modi's family belonged to the Modh-Ghanchi-Teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an Other Backward Class by the Indian government. He was falsely accused by Mayawati that he added his caste to the Other Backward Class (OBC) list as a political tool.

            <span>Childhood</span>
            <div>
                As a child, Modi is said to have helped his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. Modi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre. Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this. Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.

            <div>
                In 1978 Modi received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the School of
                Open Learning at the University of Delhi, graduating with a third class. Five years later,
                in 1983, he received a Master of Arts degree in political science from Gujarat University, 
                graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student. But there is a big 
                controversy surrounding his educational qualification. Jayantibhai Patel, a former political 
                science professor of Gujarat University, claimed that the subjects listed in Modi's MA degree
                were not offered by the university when Modi was studying there.

            <span>Career in Politics</span>
            <div>
                Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing
                health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the 
                legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002
                Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim, or otherwise 
                criticised for its management of the crisis. The Supreme Court remarked that Narendra Modi was like 
                a Modern-day Nero, looking the other way as innocent women and children were burning. Senior police 
                officer Sanjiv Bhatt and Shubhranshu Chaudhary, a BBC correspondent claimed to have attended a meeting 
                at Narendra Modi's residence where the Gujarat Chief Minister said Hindus should be allowed to vent their 
                anger against Muslims. However a Special Investigation Team, appointed by the Supreme Court, cleared Modi
                of any charges. His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. 
                His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education
                indices in the state.

            <span>Life in BJP</span>
            <div>
                Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower 
                house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's
                administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced 
                spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency 
                in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began 
                a high-profile sanitation campaign, initiated a controversial demonetisation of high-denomination 
                banknotes and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.

            <span>Chief Minister of Gujarat</span>
            <div>
                In 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in 
                by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, 
                and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in 
                Bhuj in 2001. The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, 
                and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. 
                Although BJP leader L. K. Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's 
                lack of experience in government, Modi declined an offer to be Patel's deputy chief minister, 
                telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee that he was "going to be fully responsible for Gujarat 
                or not at all". On 3 October 2001 he replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat, with the 
                responsibility of preparing the BJP for the December 2002 elections. Modi was sworn in as 
                Chief Minister on 7 October 2001, and entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 
                2002 by winning a by-election to the Rajkot – II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC
                by 14,728 votes.

        As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the
        philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. His policies 
        during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. He established
        financial and technology parks in Gujarat and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate 
        investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹17 trillion or US$220 billion in 2020) were signed.

        Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the 
        country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian 
        states. It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with 
        respect to individual consumption declined. With respect to the quality of education in government 
        schools, the state ranked below most Indian states. The social policies of the government generally 
        did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities. 
        Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas 
        or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states 
        in the Human Development Index. Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national 
        average on education and healthcare.

    <div class="container" id="tab3">
        The economic policies of Modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, 
        based on a neoliberal framework. Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing 
        more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. Other proposed 
        reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and 
        fire them; some of these proposals were dropped after protests. The reforms drew strong opposition 
        from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including 
        one affiliated with the BJP. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, a constituent of the Sangh Parivar, 
        stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.
